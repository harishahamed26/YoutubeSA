As team meetings at times were first thing in the morning, instead of say last thing of the day which i would have prefered. There was also the distrust that when left alone at work in the evening, without control, the work was not done proper. All in all i found this approach of employeers anyoing if not insulting.

Huberman recommends taking approximately 25 deep breaths to increase alertness. Alternatives like going for a walk or engaging in exercise can also serve the same purpose, depending on individual preference and circumstances.<br><br>Get Focused: To enhance focus, Huberman suggests picking a point in the room to stare at for 30 to 60 seconds without entertaining other thoughts. This simple exercise can significantly improve concentration and facilitate a smoother transition into intensive study or work.<br><br>Limit Study Sessions: Aim for a maximum of 90 minutes per study session.

If you have the top 3 down  you can train your shoulders once a or week 3 times a week low reps high reps  12 sets or 30 sets and they are going to grow.

163,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,"Three things; <br>1) Full range of motion on shoulder press movements, although it does stimulate more of your deltoids, that lower portion of the range is a high risk area. For anyone prone to rotator cuff injuries, which most of us are, the greater majority of trainers and bodybuilders recommend to always stick to 90 degree angle. <br>2) Another method to reduce usage of your traps while doing side lateral raises; roll your shoulders slightly forward and give a slightly more aggressive bend to your elbows. This will emphasize the side deltoids and reduce trap activation. <br>3) I agree with practically everything else in this video. But I am incredibly happy to see mentioning of high volume being more advantageous. So sick of this new trend promoted by lazy people to do &#39;low volume, high intensity&#39; .. especially considering they&#39;re likely not doing &#39;high intensity&#39; like they believe. Most of the recent studies have all been agreeing that high volume, with progressive overload, and high intensity, is the most effective way to build mass. Some even saying 20-30 sets per week being optimal. But it really all boils down to your sleep hygiene and nutrition. Poor sleep and poor nutrition equals poor recovery. And if you&#39;re going for high volume without full recovery.. that&#39;s when you run into problems.", 
164,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,Do you think exhausting the trapezius before doing lateral raises could also help increase the load on the lateral parts of the shoulders?, 
165,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,"The thumbnail is very misleading. There&#39;s nothing wrong with doing 12 reps, if that&#39;s the number you reach when going 1-2 reps short of failure. Numerous studies have shown that you can do as many as 30 reps, and still build the same amount of muscle as someone doing far fewer reps (but heavier). The important key is that you do enough reps till you get very, very close to failure in each set.<br><br>Also, increasing the weight is not the only way to implement progressive overload. By repping out till you get to failure or 1-2 reps short of failure, and you&#39;re doing everything else correctly, you will naturally be able to do more and more reps. That challenges the muscle and overloads it progressively without going for heavier weight. Of course, this is to a certain extent. If the rep count starts to go above 30, then gains start being left on the table.<br><br>I personally like doing higher reps with lower weight because it&#39;s easier on the joints. But that&#39;s just me....",

184,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,Studies üòÇ<br>Get the F outta here, 
185,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,Phil Heath recently said that keepings arms at 90 degrees and stopping before going past that shoulders when dropping was the best. I noticed in the vid your arms were not at a 90 degree angle. Have you tried this method? I&#39;m going to give it a go next time. I feel going all the way down hurts my shoulders., 
186,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,"I injured myself today while doing shoulders, I lifted too much", 
187,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,"Lower reps are for core strength, not growth", 
188,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,"8-10 reps on compound, 10-12 on isolation.", 
189,UC0CRYvGlWGlsGxBNgvkUbAg,c3wEEdD8tWc,So :<br>.Train full range of motion <br>.Front delts take over<br>.You have to start with the shoulders in your training day<br>.Stretch your traps to minimise there activation <br>.Progressive overload and keep track of the weight load<br>.Training volume ( doing more sets 12 to 15)<br>.Consume enough calories without going too crazy on it<br>.Eat enough proteins of course,

204,UCERm5yFZ1SptUEU4wZ2vJvw,ufrFCjERMDc,"I like thid chanel and JE is spot-on with his clearand concise discussion. <br>I learned quite a bit of this shoulder stuff in pre-op and post-op shoulder surgery using bands. Can&#39;t recommend resistance bands enough. <br>Also, I started using the techniques outlined by Dr. Doug McGuff. His main point is lower weight/resistance and slow - very slow movement on concentric and eccentric parts of the motion. His book and YT channel explains the methodology and science behind it. E.g. if you are doing 3 sets of 10, cut your speed down to as slow as you can to move the weight or engage the band go to the full range, hold, then as slow as possible to the starting position. Then, set the weight such that you can do 2 sets of three and hit failure on the 3rd set. I&#39;d say 90% of the people I see in the gym are using bad form/posture and are using momentum during the movement. <br>I&#39;ve shown this to various PTs when recovering from many surgeries due to everything from a crushed ankle, 3 ACLs, t TKR, and both shoulders). They would watch me doing bands, etc., and ask why I was doing them in slo-mo. After 30-45 mins hitting the major groups, your heart rate will be up, and you&#39;ll be cached. 6-10 day recovery time, which can be used to focus on targeting specific muscles and or problem areas, etc. While you might not get &#39;swole&#39;, you will get strong with great definition. You&#39;ll also burn fat like a fire. <br>I had a lot of ice hockey and soccer injuries and have severe osteoarthritis (some injury-related, some genetic predisposition), hence the surgeries.",

Based on my personal experience I can see that the algo is pushing content onto me that it selected that I make a point of skipping and yet it keeps sending me not only the same type of content but even the videos that I specifically asked it to not show me. The truth is, nobody understands the YouTube algo and if someone says they do, I can find data that will debunk it. Now when it comes to Paddy Galloway, he himself has never and would never work with small channels because he knows, it&#39;s an uphill battle. Pretty much anybody with an analytical mind can pull off what he did with huge channels that have a much greater margin of error and can afford to experiment because they make YouTube so much money that it will continue to push their content anyway. So far, there has been nobody who could prove that they could grow a channel super fast starting from scratch and those that tried, failed.

375,UCR5k7bm0qgpP7-QX1uIx7cQ,ryZt5pc2O5s,Color is another huge one. When you scroll slow it‚Äôll show a lot of the same color palette in the shorts. When you speed up it‚Äôll seek new color palettes to try and get you to slow down again in order to watch and engage., 
376,UCR5k7bm0qgpP7-QX1uIx7cQ,ryZt5pc2O5s,One thing may help. I found out one of my most best performing shorts are getting so much swept away so I thought it was abad indication.

455,UCJ5v_MCY6GNUBTO8-D3XoAg,58PpN0_VzQg,I predicts that Roman is going to tell Rock to acknowledge him as the tribal chief. Rock refuses and think Cody was right that he is a high chief. Roman demands he gets on his knee and acknowledge him now. Rock then confront Roman and that will set head of the table match., 
456,UCJ5v_MCY6GNUBTO8-D3XoAg,58PpN0_VzQg,They should have dropped this as The Rock was coming to claim &quot;the head of the table&quot;...But WWE didn&#39;t make this as a head of the table issue. If it was done correctly then Cody fans probably wouldn&#39;t have minded as Cody could have won the other title then win the Universal and hold both belts for a while... Hence it would have made it all worthwhile.,

460,UCJ5v_MCY6GNUBTO8-D3XoAg,58PpN0_VzQg,You gotta know the Rock wouldn&#39;t have come back if he was still a boxoffice draw in Hollywood.,

Say he is the best in his family, even better than Rock who is all hype.  He sucks at acting and hasn‚Äôt done anything good since the Mummy.  <br><br>Just keep taunting him until he comes back reluctantly, but Rock instead forced WWE‚Äôs hands which fans don‚Äôt like.  Now he lost the fans who think Punk was right.  Ironically Punk is now doing this to current WWE stars if he didn‚Äôt get injured.",
