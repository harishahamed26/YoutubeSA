Then cody can make a promo after the rock heel turn to say that he was tricked by the rock, getting him even more over. If there is someone who can take over vince the boss heel gimmick as cooperate rock its dwayne. With paul haymen pledging loyal to the rock instead of roman turning roman face in process with the bloodline turning their back on him for the rock. The Cooperate tribal cheif with heyman the cooperate wise man. They can even build it up like the rock is gonna do the right think and lose to roman at elimination chamber like cody supports wants,  then does the same like he did  in his first cooperate turn with nick being in on it ringing the bell in turn cheating roman out of the belt with sharpshooter false tap out.",

249,UCJ5v_MCY6GNUBTO8-D3XoAg,58PpN0_VzQg,How to fix the main event at WrestleMania.<br>Step one: make the rock and reigns match at elimination chamber and make it for the title of tribal chief and get the rock to beat reigns which causes him to start loosing his mind and attacking everyone  and creates enemies.<br>Step 2: make the main event at WrestleMania Cody vs reigns have it be a 1 hour no DQ iron man match which solo constantly interferes with then the rock comes out and attacks solo and takes him out  of the picture for a fair match,
